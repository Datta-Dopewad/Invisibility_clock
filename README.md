# ðŸ§™ Invisibility Cloak (OpenCV + Streamlit)

This project demonstrates the **"Invisibility Cloak"** effect using **OpenCV** in Python.  
It works in two modes:  

1. **OpenCV Live Mode** â€“ run locally with your webcam, where a specific color cloth (red/blue/green) becomes invisible.  
2. **Streamlit Web App Mode** â€“ capture background and cloak photos via your browser camera and see the effect instantly.

- Adjustable HSV thresholds via **trackbars**.  
- Real-time processing with **OpenCV**.  
- Simple web interface using **Streamlit**.  
- Works offline (no external API calls).
